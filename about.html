      <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Melissa ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m a security leader who thrives at the intersection of technology, trust, and teamwork. After years of partnering with engineering and product teams to weave security into their product roadmaps and cloud environments, Iâ€™m currently on a career breakâ€”dedicating time to upskilling, refreshing my knowledge, and exploring the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity.
        <br><br>Most recently, I served as a Principal Security Partner at Adobe, guiding security initiatives across three business units, comprising over 30 solution teams. A significant portion of my work focused on risk management, which involved identifying high-impact security risks, prioritizing them against business objectives, and developing remediation strategies that balanced innovation with trust. Earlier in my career, I supported U.S. government agencies in building cybersecurity resilience, taught IT as a Peace Corps volunteer in Vanuatu, and even kept Taco Bell restaurants running smoothly with a mix of tech troubleshooting and data-driven problem-solving.
        <br><br>What drives me is connectionâ€”whether itâ€™s translating complex compliance requirements into something human, mentoring teams to adopt secure coding practices, or helping leaders make informed risk decisions that keep customers and businesses protected.
        <br><br>When Iâ€™m not nerding out over security stuff and new tech, youâ€™ll probably find me outdoors running, doing yoga, or planning my next travel destination!</p>
